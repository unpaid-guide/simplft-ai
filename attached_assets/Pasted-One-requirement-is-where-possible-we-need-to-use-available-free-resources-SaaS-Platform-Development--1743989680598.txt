One requirement is where possible we need to use available free resources SaaS Platform Development Plan

Phase 1 (MVP) & Phase 2 Development Breakdown

Overview

We are bootstrapping the business and need to develop a proprietary SaaS platform in stages to minimize costs, enhance investor appeal, and ensure scalability. Our focus is on building an MVP under $2000 that will allow us to showcase the core functionality to customers while preparing for future expansions.
	â€¢	Platform: Proprietary development on Replit (Python, FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL) instead of Odoo.
	â€¢	Core Model: Token-Based Subscription Model with AI functionalities (future phases).
	â€¢	Pricing Model: Consultative Approach, meaning pricing is customized per customer based on their needs.
	â€¢	Key Features in MVP: Payment Gateway, Subscription Management, Quotes & Invoices, Token Utilization, Discount Authorization Workflow.
	â€¢	Long-Term Goal: Gradual development of AI-based automation and advanced analytics once funding is secured.
